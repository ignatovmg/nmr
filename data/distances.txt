The list of proton pairs you can use to check your structures is below. 
Obviously, the proton pairs, such as glycil alpha protons, 
and leucine's methyl, which are separated by a naturally fixed distance 
are not included in the list.  This list is just a rough estimate, 
and it was NOT obtained from a full relaxation matrix calculations.
To discriminate magnetically non-equivalent nuclei, I denote them as H and H', 
or Me and Me'. This always refers to the same atoms, although it is hard 
to tell from these spectra alone which of the two diastereotopic atoms each 
of them is.
Unfortunately, the Leu-N-methyl, Phe H alpha, and Asp H beta resonances 
coincide, and this does not allow us to use them for obtaining distance 
restrains. 

Short distance (2 - 2.25A, starting from the smallest distance):
Asp H beta'-H alpha
(80,81)     (79)
Arg H beta - H alpha
(52,53)     (51)
Asp H beta - H alpha

(the distances in between 2.25 - 3 A are only between the protons belonging to leucine residue, so they are not included as non informative) 

-------Medium distance (3 - 3.7 A, starting from the smallest distance):

Gly H - Arg H alpha (this peak is close to the diagonal, so don't trust to this distance too much)
(68,69)  (51)

Leu Me' - Arg H beta
(37,38,39) (52,53)

Asp H alpha - Phe phenyl (distance to the center of the benzene ring
(79)          (15,16,17,18,19,20)

-------------------Long distance (3.7 -4.5 A)

Leu Me - Asp H alpha
(37,38,39)   (79)

Leu H alpha - Phe phenyl
(28)         (15,16,17,18,19,20)

Leu Me - Phe phenyl
(37,38,39) (15,16,17,18,19,20)

Leu Me' - Arg H alpha
(37,38,39)  (51)


Actually, upon meditation I realized the preliminary distances set I send you may be less informative that what was left beyond the scope. The most informative are the data about cross-peack that are MISSING from the spectrum, which means the distance between the protons they correspond to is greater that 6 A

Concretely,
1. one methyl of Leu's isopropyl and phenylalanine's phenyl.
   (33,34,35) or (30,31,32) to (15,16,17,18,19,20)
2. ANOTHER methyl of Leu's isopropyl and Arg's H-alpha and H-beta.
                                               51          52,53
3. BOTH methyls of Leu's isopropyl and Arg's H-gamma/delta.
                                             (54,55)   (56,57)
4. Asp's H-beta sees only adjacent Gly's Ha and Phe (WHAT?)
         (80,81)                   (68,69)      
5. Phe's Hb sees only its neihgbours' backbone protons, and it does not see other residues.
   (13,14)
